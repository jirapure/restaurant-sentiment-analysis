# restaurant-sentiment-analysis
Normally, a lot of businesses are remained as failures due to lack of profit, lack of proper improvement measures. Mostly, restaurant owners face a lot of difficulties to improve their productivity. This project really helps those who want to increase their productivity, which in turn increases their business profits. This is the main objective of this project.

What the project does is that the restaurant owner gets to know about drawbacks of his restaurant such as most disliked food items of his restaurant by customerâ€™s text review which is processed with ML classification algorithm(Naive Bayes)

The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative. To do so, we will work on Restaurant Review dataset, we will load it into predicitve algorithms Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the review's sentiment.
